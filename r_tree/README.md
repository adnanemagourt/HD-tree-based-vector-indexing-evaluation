The construction of an R-Tree involves partitioning data points into groups, selecting seeds for the initial division, and assigning points to these groups based on certain criteria. Let's break down the various steps and approaches described in your request.

### 1. **R-Tree Overview**

An **R-Tree** is a balanced tree structure that partitions data into bounding boxes, typically rectangles (in 2D or higher-dimensional spaces). The key idea is to group nearby points together in bounding rectangles and recursively split these rectangles as the tree grows.

### 2. **Dividing the Data into Two Groups**

The first step in creating an R-Tree involves dividing the set of data points into two groups. The selection of these groups and their seeds is crucial for balancing the tree's structure and ensuring efficient spatial queries. We are given two primary methods for dividing the data into two groups, which involve choosing **two seeds**.

#### a) **Choosing a Dimension and Selecting Two Farthest Points (Similar to KD-Tree's Discriminant)**

- **Step 1**: First, a dimension is selected for the split. This can be done in several ways, analogous to the discriminant choices in a KD-Tree (alternating, random, maximum variance, or widest interval). We choose a dimension over which the split will occur.
  
- **Step 2**: After choosing a dimension, we select two **seeds**, which are the points that will serve as the initial centers of the two groups. These points should be chosen such that they are as far apart as possible along the selected dimension.

Let $ P = \{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\} $ be the set of points, and $ d \in D = \{1, 2, \ldots, k\} $ be the selected dimension. We want to select two points $ p_i, p_j $ such that the distance between them along dimension $ d $ is maximized:
$$
\text{distance}_{d}(p_i, p_j) = |p_{i,d} - p_{j,d}|
$$
where $ p_{i,d} $ is the coordinate of point $ p_i $ along dimension $ d $.

#### b) **Iterating Over All Pairs of Points and Choosing the Pair with the Longest Distance**

Alternatively, we can iterate over all possible pairs of points and select the pair $ (p_i, p_j) $ that has the greatest Euclidean distance between them. The Euclidean distance between two points $ p_i $ and $ p_j $ in $ k $-dimensional space is given by:
$$
\text{distance}(p_i, p_j) = \sqrt{\sum_{d=1}^{k} (p_{i,d} - p_{j,d})^2}
$$
We then select the pair $ (p_i, p_j) $ that maximizes this distance.

### 3. **Iterating Over the Points and Assigning Them to One of the Two Groups**

Once the two seeds are chosen, we need to assign the remaining points to one of the two groups. The strategy for making these assignments depends on balancing two competing objectives:
1. **Sacrifice Tree Balancing**: This strategy focuses on grouping points that are spatially close to the seed of the group, which can lead to imbalanced groups in terms of size.
2. **Sacrifice Clustering**: This strategy ensures the groups are balanced in size, possibly sacrificing clustering quality.

#### a) **Sacrifice Clustering**

In this strategy, each point is assigned to the group whose seed is closest to it. For each point $ p_i $, we compute the Euclidean distance to the seed of group 1 ($ s_1 $) and the seed of group 2 ($ s_2 $):
$$
\text{distance}(p_i, s_1) = \sqrt{\sum_{d=1}^{k} (p_{i,d} - s_{1,d})^2}, \quad \text{distance}(p_i, s_2) = \sqrt{\sum_{d=1}^{k} (p_{i,d} - s_{2,d})^2}
$$
Then, point $ p_i $ is assigned to group 1 if $ \text{distance}(p_i, s_1) < \text{distance}(p_i, s_2) $, otherwise, it is assigned to group 2.

#### b) **Sacrifice Tree Balancing**

To balance the tree, we assign points to each group in such a way that both groups have approximately equal sizes. One way to do this is to sort all points based on their distance to a single seed, and then divide the points into two equal groups.

- **Step 1**: Choose one of the seeds (say, $ s_1 $).
- **Step 2**: For each point $ p_i $, calculate the distance to $ s_1 $, i.e., $ \text{distance}(p_i, s_1) $.
- **Step 3**: Sort the points based on these distances in ascending order.
- **Step 4**: Divide the sorted list of points into two equal-sized groups.

Let $ d(p_i, s_1) $ represent the distance between point $ p_i $ and seed $ s_1 $. After sorting the points, the division is done such that:
$$
\text{Group 1} = \{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{n/2}\}, \quad \text{Group 2} = \{p_{n/2+1}, p_{n/2+2}, \ldots, p_n\}
$$
where $ n $ is the total number of points.

### 4. **Summary of Key Formulas**

- **Choosing Seeds**:
  - For dimension-based farthest selection: $ \text{distance}_{d}(p_i, p_j) = |p_{i,d} - p_{j,d}| $
  - For Euclidean distance-based farthest selection: $ \text{distance}(p_i, p_j) = \sqrt{\sum_{d=1}^{k} (p_{i,d} - p_{j,d})^2} $
  
- **Assigning Points to Groups**:
  - **Sacrifice Tree Balancing**: 
    - Assign $ p_i $ to group 1 if $ \text{distance}(p_i, s_1) < \text{distance}(p_i, s_2) $, else assign to group 2.
  - **Sacrifice Clustering**:
    - Calculate $ \text{distance}(p_i, s_1) $ for all points, sort the points, and divide into two equal groups.

### 5. **Computational Complexity Considerations**

- **Selecting the seeds**: 
  - The **distance-based seed selection** requires calculating the distance between all pairs of points, resulting in a time complexity of $ O(n^2) $ for $ n $ points.
  - The **dimension-based selection** requires iterating over the points for each dimension, so its complexity is $ O(n \cdot k) $, which is generally more efficient when $ k $ is smaller than $ n $.

- **Assigning points to groups**:
  - **Sacrifice Tree Balancing**: For each point, we compute the distance to both seeds, so the complexity is $ O(n) $.
  - **Sacrifice Clustering**: Sorting the points based on their distance to the seed takes $ O(n \log n) $.

Therefore, the overall complexity of partitioning the data into two groups can range from $ O(n^2) $ for seed selection to $ O(n \log n) $ for the balancing strategy, depending on the method used for selecting seeds and assigning points.
